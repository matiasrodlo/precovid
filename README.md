**Description:**

Our main mission was to contribute to the relief of the burden on healthcare lines, while providing data and recommendations based on the symptoms of each caller. Since the beginning of the pandemic, several healthcare professionals volunteered to handle inquiries from possible non-critical cases and provide information through social media, aiming to prevent the saturation of the healthcare system and reserve it for those who truly need it. It was in this context that a group of professionals and students decided to join forces to create Precovid.org.

This website has been designed to assist citizens throughout Latin America in self-assessing possible COVID-19 symptoms and providing updated information and personalized advice based on their health status.

To start the self-assessment, users must enter their personal information and location. Once this information is provided, the platform will proceed to ask a series of questions to determine the possible presence of a COVID-19 case.

Our team consists of doctors, engineers, and journalists. Despite most of us having never met in person, we have come together with the purpose of saving lives.
